--  Instantiation with Float

--  As a special exception, if other files instantiate generics from
--  SAL, or you link SAL object files with other files to produce
--  an executable, that does not by itself cause the resulting
--  executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License. This
--  exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
--  executable file might be covered by the GNU Public License.
