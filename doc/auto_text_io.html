<h1>Auto_Text_IO</h1>

<p>Last updated: 2020-04-16 UNRELEASED</p>

<p>Auto_Text_IO is a tool for automatically generating a Text_IO
package for an Ada package. The generated package contains Put and Get
subprograms for all the types in the Ada package, implemented via
Ada.Text_IO. The Put and Get subprograms can use named notation
aggregates (although Get does not support the full flexibility of Ada
source code; in particular, the components of aggregates must be in
declaration order). This makes it extremely easy to generate
well-formatted output for Ada packages, and is one way to provide
persistent storage in a readable form (see SAL.Config_Files for
another way).</p>

<p>Auto_Text_IO is an <a
href="http://info.acm.org/sigada/WG/asiswg/">ASIS</a> application. It
also uses some <a
href="http://stephe-leake.org/ada/sal.html">SAL</a> data
structures, and uses other SAL packages at run-time. It currently uses
the GNAT implementation of ASIS, including some ASIS extensions. I'd
be interested to help in porting it to other ASIS implementations.</p>

<p>Auto_Text_IO uses ASIS to iterate thru all the types declared in a
package (called the &quot;parent&quot;). It creates a one or two child packages,
containing Get and Put routines for each type. For scalar types,
Auto_Text_IO generates an instantiation of the appropriate Ada.Text_IO
package. For array types, it instantiates a package from
SAL.Gen_Array_IO, a run-time package provided with SAL. For record
types, it generates code to Put and Get an aggregate, optionally using
named notation. For fully private types (that are not visible in the
public part of the parent spec), it generates a separate private child
package. The Get routine can read what Put outputs.</p>

<p>Auto_Text_IO generates Ada 2005 code.
However, an Ada 2012 capable compiler is required due to internal use of
Ada2012 features.</p>

<p>Most Ada types are supported. If you find one that isn't, it can
probably be added.

<hr>
<p>Auto_Text_IO is a command-line application. Here is a description
of the command line: <br>
<tt> auto_text_io [options] filename</tt><br>
<dl>
  <dt>filename
  <dd>Parent package source file

  <dt>-d, --debug
  <dd>Output debug information

  <dt>-v
  <dd>Specify verbose mode; less than debug, more than normal.

  <dt>-f
  <dd>Replace an existing Text_IO child (if any)

  <dt>-q
  <dd>Quiet mode - do not output some messages

  <dt>-o
  <dd>Set output directory

  <dt>-Pfile
  <dd>Specify a GNAT project file for the source code.

  <dt>-t
  <dd>Overwrite the existing GNAT tree file

  <dt>-k
  <dd>Do not remove the GNAT tree file

  <dt>-r
  <dd>Reuse the GNAT tree file instead of re-creating it. -r also implies -k

  <dt>-i=arg
  <dd>Number of spaces used for indenting the generated code (arg in 1 .. 9)

  <dt>-p
  <dd>Create Output Folders.

  <dt>--version
  <dd>Print version.

  <dt>-h, --help
  <dd>Output this help information

  <dt>--text_io
  <dd>Generate Text_Io.

  <dt>--images
  <dd>Generate Image functions.

  <dt>--json
  <dd>Generate JSON.

</dl>

<p>If errors are encountered, no Text_IO child is produced. Errors are
reported to standard error in standard Gnu format. If the gnatprep
preprocessor is used, with option '-r', the auto_text_io error
messages refer to the user source file, not the gnatprep output
intermediate file.</p>

<p>A previous version of auto_text_io would output a Text_IO child in
the presence of some warnings (such as a type not being supported).
However, this turned out to be difficult to support cleanly, so now
all unsupported types are reported as errors; the user must add &quot;--
auto_text_io: ignore&quot; comments.</p>

<p>There are special comments you can use to annotate your code,
to influence what Auto_Text_IO does.</p>

<pre> --  Auto_Text_IO : ignore
--  Auto_Text_IO : separate
</pre>

<p><tt>--  Auto_Text_IO : ignore</tt> preceding a type declaration
excludes the type from Auto_Text_IO processing. This is useful if the
type is not yet supported by Auto_Text_IO; it suppresses the warning
message.</p>

<p><tt>--  Auto_Text_IO : ignore</tt> preceding a generic formal
package excludes it; see the <a
href="auto_text_io_manual.html">Auto_Text_IO Manual</a> for more
information.</p>

<p><tt>--  Auto_Text_IO : separate</tt> preceding a type declaration
tells Auto_Text_IO that the user will provide the core Put and Get
routines for the type, to provide special processing such as output
format or input validation. See the <a
href="auto_text_io_manual.html">Auto_Text_IO Manual</a> for more
information.</p>

<p>The file <tt>Source/gps.menu</tt> contains XML code to add
Auto_Text_IO to the GPS menu. Copy it to ~/.gps.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Test code</h1>

<p>There is complete test code for the Auto_Text_IO package. A set of
example Ada packages is provided, with at least one of each type
supported by Auto_Text_IO. In addition, all of the Text_IO child
packages in SAL are generated by Auto_Text_IO; that serves as a test
of the support for generic packages. The test driver calls Put for
each type, then reads the result file with Get, verifying the
correctness of Auto_Text_IO. There is a smaller test for Ada 83 mode,
and another test that verifies some of the error messages generated by
Auto_Text_IO. The makefile runs all the tests.</p>

<P>If you find a bug in Auto_Text_IO, or have a patch that provides an
improvement, let <a href="mailto:stephen_leake@stephe-leake.org">me</a>
know.</p>

<h1><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h1>

<p>Auto_Text_IO is distributed in source form only. There are two
parts; the source for the Auto_Text_IO tool, and the source for the
run-time components, which is in SAL. </p>

<p>If you'd like to compile Auto_Text_IO the way I do, see my <a
href="sal.html#installation">SAL</a> page for the list of tools I use.
I give instructions here for using these tools (GNAT and Gnu make).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install SAL as described in <a href="sal.html#installation">SAL</a>.
  <li>Download <a href="auto_text_io-3.05.tar.gz">auto_text_io-3.05.tar.gz</a>.
  <li>Extract to the same root directory as SAL.
  <li>Download <a href="https://libre2.adacore.com/">asis-gpl-2008-src.tgz</a>.
  <li>Extract to a directory of your choice; typically the root directory of the GNAT installation.
  <li>In file<tt>asis-2008-src/Makefile.stub</tt>, change INSTALL_DIR
      to a directory of your choice; I use <tt>GNAT/local</tt>
  <li>In directory <tt>asis-2008-src</tt>, run <tt>make install</tt>
  <li>Define <tt>GNAT_ASIS</tt> as an environment
      variable; its value must be the absolute path to the directory
      containing the file <tt>asis.gpr</tt>. In my case, that's <tt>GNAT/local/lib/gnat</tt>.
  <li>Define <tt>INSTALL_BIN</tt> as an environment
      variable; its value must be the absolute path to the directory
      where you want to install the auto_text_io executable.
  <li>From directory <tt>Auto_Text_IO/Build/x86_gnu_*_release</tt>,
  run <tt>make</tt>. Windows, Linux and Lynx build directories are
  provided. This will build the auto_text_io executable, and run all
  the tests. Note that even on Linux and Lynx, the executable file
  name ends in &quot;.exe&quot;; that simplifies the makefile.
  <li>run <tt>make install</tt> to copy the executable to the
  installation directory.
  <li>Include <tt>SAL</tt> in your project; it contains the run-time
  packages that are &quot;with&quot;ed by the code generated by
  auto_text_io.
  <li><tt>Makerules/auto_text_io_rules.make</tt> has an example make rule you can use for Auto_Text_IO.
      It places all automatically generated output in the
      sub-directory $AUTO_TEXT_IO_DIR, where it can be easily ignored by
      configuration management tools, and easily deleted by <tt>make
      clean</tt>.
</ol>
